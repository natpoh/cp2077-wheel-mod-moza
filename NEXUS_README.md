# Cyberpunk 2077 — Logitech G-series Steering Wheel Mod

**v2.31.0** for Cyberpunk 2077 game patch 2.31.

Drive Cyberpunk 2077 with a Logitech G-series steering wheel. Your wheel handles steering, throttle, brake, and clutch. Force feedback fires from in-game physics (centering as you turn, cornering load, surface texture, collision jolts, slip when you lose grip). Rev-strip LEDs follow real engine RPM. When the in-car radio is on, the rev strip becomes a music visualizer.

There is no virtual gamepad to install, no XInput shim, no third-party driver. The wheel talks to the game via the official Logitech Steering Wheel SDK (the same one driving sims use).

## Supported wheels

The mod was designed to work with any wheel that is compatible with Logitech G Hub.

I tested with:

- G923 (Xbox variant)
- G920

But theoretically these should all be compatible:

- WingMan Formula Force, Formula Force GP
- Driving Force, Driving Force Pro, Driving Force GT
- Momo Force, Momo Racing
- G25, G27, G29, G920
- G923 (Xbox, PS, PC variants)
- Formula Vibration Feedback

The mod auto-detects what hardware your wheel actually has (force feedback motor, rev-strip LEDs, lower-cluster buttons) and only shows the relevant settings.

Non-Logitech wheels (Thrustmaster, Fanatec, Moza) are not supported.

## Required mods

1. **[RED4ext](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380)**
1. **[redscript](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511)**
1. **[ArchiveXL](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198)**
1. **[Mod Settings](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885)** v0.2.21 or later

## Required drivers

- **[Logitech G HUB](https://www.logitech.com/innovation/g-hub.html)**

## Install

1. Click the **Vortex** download button on this page (the green button in the Files tab).
1. Vortex will ask about a file conflict on `mod_settings.dll`. Choose this mod to win the conflict (load after Mod Settings). The included file is a small patch on top of upstream Mod Settings.

(Manual Download is also available if you don't use Vortex, but Mod Manager Download is the supported path. If you go manual, you handle the file conflict on `mod_settings.dll` yourself by overwriting upstream Mod Settings' DLL with the one from this zip.)

## G HUB

This mod respects G HUB. Wheel rotation range, sensitivity, and centering spring stay with G HUB; the mod reads the rotation range and scales its force feedback to match. G HUB and this mod can both be running at the same time.

If you have wheel buttons configured in your G HUB Cyberpunk profile that overlap with the bindings here, you may get doubled keypresses. Clear the overlapping bindings from your G HUB Cyberpunk profile.

I recommend starting with an operating range of 180 to start, since the rotation will match the animation you see in 1st person view inside of a car. I tend to like it a bit wider to help mitigate fishtailing.

## Troubleshooting

- **Wheel detected but the car doesn't move.** Make sure RED4ext is installed and current.
- **Settings page is missing.** Mod Settings or ArchiveXL aren't installed correctly. The wheel will still work on defaults.
- **Three orphan toggles named `hasFfbHardware` / `hasRevLeds` / `hasRightCluster` show up in settings.** Vortex installed stock Mod Settings on top of the patched build that ships with this mod. Re-deploy in Vortex and let this mod win the file conflict.
- **Doubled keypresses on D-pad or A/B/X/Y.** G HUB and this mod are both binding the same keys. Reset the wheel-button entries in your G HUB Cyberpunk profile back to their default bindings.
